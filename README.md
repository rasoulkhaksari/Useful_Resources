## **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**
## Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems

![](asset/hand-on_ML420.jpg)

The updated edition of this best-selling book uses concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks--Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow 2--to help you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. Practitioners will learn a range of techniques that they can quickly put to use on the job. Part 1 employs Scikit-Learn to introduce fundamental machine learning tasks, such as simple linear regression. Part 2, which has been significantly updated, employs Keras and TensorFlow 2 to guide the reader through more advanced machine learning methods using deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what you've learned, all you need is programming experience to get started.

## **Python for Data Analysis**
## Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython

![](asset/Python_for_Data_Analysis.jpg)

Python for Data Analysis is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. It is also a practical, modern introduction to scientific computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive applications. This is a book about the parts of the Python language and libraries you’ll need to effectively solve a broad set of data analysis problems. This book is not an exposition on analytical methods using Python as the implementation language.

Written by Wes McKinney, the main author of the pandas library, this hands-on book is packed with practical cases studies. It’s ideal for analysts new to Python and for Python programmers new to scientific computing.

- Use the IPython interactive shell as your primary development environment
- Learn basic and advanced NumPy (Numerical Python) features
- Get started with data analysis tools in the pandas library
- Use high-performance tools to load, clean, transform, merge, and reshape data
- Create scatter plots and static or interactive visualizations with matplotlib
- Apply the pandas groupby facility to slice, dice, and summarize datasets
- Measure data by points in time, whether it’s specific instances, fixed periods, or intervals
- Learn how to solve problems in web analytics, social sciences, finance, and economics, through detailed examples

## **Machine Learning with Python Cookbook: Practical Solutions from Preprocessing to Deep Learning**

![](asset/machine-learning-with-python-cookbook.jpg)

This book is not an introduction to machine learning. If you are not comfortable with the basic concepts of machine learning or have never spent time learning machine learning, do not buy this book. Instead, this book is for the machine learning practitioner who, while comfortable with the theory and concepts of machine learning, would benefit from a quick reference containing code to solve challenges he runs into working on machine learning on an everyday basis.

This book assumes the reader is comfortable with the Python programming language and package management.

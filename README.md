## **Python for Data Analysis**
## Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython

![](asset/Python_for_Data_Analysis.jpg)

Python for Data Analysis is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning, and crunching data in Python. It is also a practical, modern introduction to scientific computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive applications. This is a book about the parts of the Python language and libraries you’ll need to effectively solve a broad set of data analysis problems. This book is not an exposition on analytical methods using Python as the implementation language.

Written by Wes McKinney, the main author of the pandas library, this hands-on book is packed with practical cases studies. It’s ideal for analysts new to Python and for Python programmers new to scientific computing.

- Use the IPython interactive shell as your primary development environment
- Learn basic and advanced NumPy (Numerical Python) features
- Get started with data analysis tools in the pandas library
- Use high-performance tools to load, clean, transform, merge, and reshape data
- Create scatter plots and static or interactive visualizations with matplotlib
- Apply the pandas groupby facility to slice, dice, and summarize datasets
- Measure data by points in time, whether it’s specific instances, fixed periods, or intervals
- Learn how to solve problems in web analytics, social sciences, finance, and economics, through detailed examples

## **Machine Learning with Python Cookbook: Practical Solutions from Preprocessing to Deep Learning**

![](asset/machine-learning-with-python-cookbook.jpg)

This book is not an introduction to machine learning. If you are not comfortable with the basic concepts of machine learning or have never spent time learning machine learning, do not buy this book. Instead, this book is for the machine learning practitioner who, while comfortable with the theory and concepts of machine learning, would benefit from a quick reference containing code to solve challenges he runs into working on machine learning on an everyday basis.

This book assumes the reader is comfortable with the Python programming language and package management.

## **Practical Statistics for Data Scientists**
## 50+ Essential Concepts Using R and Python by Peter Bruce, Andrew Bruce, Peter Gedeck

![](asset/Practical_Statistics_for_Data_Scientists.jpg)

Statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet few data scientists have formal statistical training. Courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. The second edition of this popular guide adds comprehensive examples in Python, provides practical guidance on applying statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what’s important and what’s not.

Many data science resources incorporate statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. If you’re familiar with the R or Python programming languages and have some exposure to statistics, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format.

With this book, you’ll learn:

- Why exploratory data analysis is a key preliminary step in data science
- How random sampling can reduce bias and yield a higher-quality dataset, even with big data
- How the principles of experimental design yield definitive answers to questions
- How to use regression to estimate outcomes and detect anomalies
- Key classification techniques for predicting which categories a record belongs to
- Statistical machine learning methods that "learn" from data
- Unsupervised learning methods for extracting meaning from unlabeled data.
